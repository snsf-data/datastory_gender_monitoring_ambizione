The data used in this data story are available in the folder `data`. The data consist of a single file (`data/data.csv`) containing information about 4175 Ambizione proposals submitted between February 2012 and November 2022. Each line represents a single application. Here follows a description of the variables included in the data:

-   `call_end_date`: the date when the call ended.
-   `research_area`: the SNSF distinguishes three major research domains (Humanities and Social Sciences (SSH), Mathematics, Natural and Engineering Sciences (MINT), and Life Sciences (LS)).
-   `is_approved`: whether the proposal has been approved for funding (TRUE is yes and FALSE is no).
-   `gender`: the gender of the applicant (Male or Female).
-   `academic_age`: the number of completed years since the PhD degree date (serves as a proxy for experience in research). **This data is only available on request!**
-   `inst_type`: type of research institution (of the applicant's affiliation), according to the following classification: Cantonal University (coded as "Cantonal university"), University of Applied Sciences or University of Teacher Education (coded as "UAS/UTE"), institutions from the ETH Domain (coded as "ETH domain"), other institutions (coded as "Other"). **This data is only available on request!**
-   `previous_snsf_funding`: whether the applicant previously got funding from the SNSF, according to the following categories: "Grant(s)" (previously received an SNSF grant), "Employment(s) only" (was an employee on an SNSF grant but never a grant recipient), "None" (received no funds from the SNSF). **This data is only available on request!**
